# Description
In this project, a practical spam classifier was built with support vector machine. For a typical email, we first conduct preprocessing and map the content into a critical feature space. Then the training and testing of support vector machine is performed. In this project, 1000 training samples and 100 testing samples are introduced. We collate three kinds of kernel function (Gaussian, Polynomial, and Linear) accordingly, and explore best parameter for each function. We find that, for this spam classification problem, linear kernel has best performance since the feature space is exactly high-dimensional. Besides, we change the penalty parameter exponentially and find reasonable values. Finally, we build another classifier with Na√Øve Bayes Model. Result shows that the SVM has better performance in this case.
